## Cluster Analysis {#cluster}

This is a draft for clustering sub-chapter.

Cluster analysis is a type of unsupervised machine learning where the goal is to find patterns within the data by grouping them into clusters where each cluster contains similar observations. 
The similarity is based on specified metrics that are task and application dependent. 

The development is mostly done but the feedback and comments are always welcome
